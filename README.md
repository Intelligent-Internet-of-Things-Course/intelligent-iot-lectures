## 🔧 Content Generation and Conversion

The conversion of markdown files to PDF, HTML, and ePub formats is done using `pandoc`, a versatile document converter.
Pandoc supports a wide range of input and output formats, making it an ideal tool for this purpose.
Useful resources and links for `pandoc` used in this repository:

- 📖 Official Pandoc documentation: [Link](https://pandoc.org/documentation.html)
- 🐳 Docker image for Pandoc: 
    - [Pandoc Core Link](https://hub.docker.com/r/pandoc/core)
    - [Pandoc Extra with Latex Link](https://hub.docker.com/r/pandoc/extra)
- 🎨 Gallery of Pandoc templates: [Link](https://pandoc-templates.org/)
- 📄 Template: [Eisvogel](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template?tab=readme-ov-file)

### 🚀 How to use the PDF, HTML and ePub generation scripts

The script `file_generator.sh` can be used to generate PDF, HTML, and ePub versions of the markdown files. 
It is based on the `Docker` version of `pandoc` and requires `docker` to be installed on your system.
To generate the files, run the script with the desired output format as an argument. For example, to generate PDF files, use:

```bash
chmod +x file_generator.sh
./file_generator.sh
```

This will create the PDF, HTML, and ePub files in the main directory.
Already generated files are available in the different subdirectories for each format.
