![](images/piazza_san_pietro.png)    

**Figure 1.5:** What a difference 8 years makes: St. Peter’s Square in 2005 and yesterday (2013)” (Facebook NBC News).

This image hides an interesting aspect on what we are not seeing and able to support this massive number of mobile devices. The answer is the **Network and Internet infrastructures, which are the backbone of the mobile revolution and are able to support the increasing demand for data and connectivity combined with Cloud Computing infrastructures and services**.

Those infrastructures evolved a lot in the last 20 years, and they are still evolving to support the new requirements of the mobile world and as we will see in this course, the Internet of Things world.

Another interesting example is the event of the concert of Vasco Rossi in Modena Park, July 2017, where more than 230K people attended the event and almost all of them were using their mobile devices to share the event in real time.

![](images/olivetti_modena_park.png)

### 1.5.1 Mobile & Wearable Computing

Another interesting aspect of the mobile revolution is the rise of wearable computing devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and augmented reality glasses. These devices are designed to be worn on the body and provide users with real-time access to information, notifications, and health monitoring features.

![](images/wearable_computing.png)

**Figure 1.7:** Wearable Computing Devices

Nowadays, we are not just associated to one or two mobile devices, but we are surrounded by a plethora of connected devices that are becoming an integral part of our daily lives. From smart home devices to connected cars, the Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we interact with our environment and the world around us. 

This devices creates a new paradigm where the physical and digital worlds are increasingly interconnected, leading to new opportunities and challenges in terms of connectivity, security, and data management.

# 2 The Internet of Things (IoT) Evolution & Revolution

In the context of the mobile revolution, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative concept that envisions a world where everyday objects are connected to the internet, enabling them to collect and exchange data. The IoT represents a significant evolution in the way we interact with technology, 
as it extends connectivity beyond traditional computing devices to encompass a wide range of physical objects and environments.

> The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the idea of a network of networks with billions of uniquely identified physical devices
> denoted also as **Smart Objects** organized in an **Internet-like structure**.
> Smart Objects are items such as sensors, consumer devices, and enterprise assets that are **connected to both the Internet and each other**.

![](images/iot_pillars.png)

**Figure 1.8:** IoT Pillars - Communication Technologies (e.g., LoRa, NB-IoT), Hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino), Software (e.g., C/C++, Python, Linux, RTOS) and Protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP).

One of the **key characteristics of the Internet of Things (IoT)** is its reliance on the **Internet** itself. 
The IoT is not simply about connecting devices; it is about connecting them **using standard Internet protocols**, rather than proprietary solutions. This approach is **crucial for achieving scalability, interoperability, and global accessibility** in IoT systems.

At the core of IoT connectivity is the **Internet Protocol (IP)**, which provides a **universal and standardized method for devices to communicate and exchange data** across networks. 
Devices that join an IoT network are **directly or indirectly connected to an IP network**, allowing them to be **addressed, managed, and integrated using standard IP-based protocols**.
By leveraging **IP as a common protocol**, IoT devices can not only communicate with each other, but also **connect seamlessly to the broader Internet and cloud services**. This enables **new opportunities for data storage, processing, and analysis**, and supports the development of **innovative applications and services** on a global scale.

A key element to consider it that being connected to the Internet is not mandatory for all the devices, but they must be able to communicate using IP protocols, even if they are connected to a local network that is not directly connected to the Internet.
We can have IoT deployments that are fully connected to the Internet, partially connected, or even completely isolated from it, depending on the specific use case and requirements.
The common factor is that the devices must be able to communicate using IP protocols, regardless of their connectivity to the broader Internet.

![](images/iot_stack.png)

**Figure 1.9:** IoT Protocol Stack vs Traditional Networking Stack.

IoT device cannot always use the traditional Internet protocol stack due to their **resource constraints** (e.g., limited processing power, memory, and energy).
For this reason, IoT devices often use **lightweight protocols** that are specifically designed for resource-constrained environments. 
These protocols are optimized for low power consumption, reduced bandwidth usage, and efficient data transmission.

For example, two widely adopted protocols in IoT applications are **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** and **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)**. 

- **MQTT** is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for efficient communication between devices with limited bandwidth and resources. It is commonly used for telemetry and remote monitoring in IoT scenarios. MQTT can be compared to traditional enterprise messaging protocols such as **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)**, as both support the publish-subscribe paradigm, but MQTT is optimized for constrained environments.

- **CoAP** is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with resource-constrained devices and networks. It follows a request/response model similar to **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**, but is much more lightweight, making it suitable for IoT deployments where minimizing overhead is critical.

These protocols are specifically engineered to be lightweight and efficient, addressing the limitations of IoT devices in terms of processing power, memory, and energy consumption. In contrast, traditional protocols like HTTP and **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** are more resource-intensive and may not be practical for all IoT scenarios.

The **adoption of standard Internet protocols**—such as **IP, TCP, UDP, and HTTP**—along with 
the use of **lightweight alternatives** like **MQTT** and **CoAP**, is **essential** for the successful 
implementation and widespread adoption of IoT systems. By leveraging these protocols,
**IoT devices can achieve seamless connectivity, interoperability, and scalability**, enabling a wide range of applications 
and services that enhance our daily lives and transform various industries.

For example, **smart home devices** (e.g., thermostats, lights, and security cameras) use standard protocols 
to communicate with mobile apps and cloud platforms, allowing users to monitor and control their homes remotely. 
In **industrial IoT**, sensors and machines use MQTT to transmit telemetry data to centralized dashboards 
for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. **Healthcare wearables** leverage CoAP to efficiently 
send patient data to hospital systems for continuous health tracking.

Furthermore, the use of **standard Internet protocols facilitates the integration of IoT devices with existing IT infrastructure and cloud services**, 
enabling new opportunities for **data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**. 
For instance, IoT sensors in agriculture can use lightweight protocols like MQTT to efficiently transmit environmental data—such as soil moisture, 
temperature, and humidity—to cloud-based analytics platforms. MQTT optimizes communication between resource-constrained devices and the cloud 
by enabling reliable, low-bandwidth data transfer. Once collected, this data can be exposed via HTTP APIs, 
making it accessible to traditional applications such as dashboards for real-time monitoring or AI models for advanced analytics. 
This seamless integration of IoT protocols and standard web technologies enables organizations 
to build smarter, more responsive, and data-driven solutions across domains.

## 2.3 From Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) to IoT

**Wireless Ad-hoc Sensor Networks (WSN)** are considered the **precursors** to the modern **Internet of Things (IoT)**, 
but they operated without a common, shared **IP network**. WSNs laid the foundation for pervasive interaction between people and their environments, 
with their potential captured in the three key elements of their acronym:

- **Wireless**: Emphasizes the freedom and **mobility** enabled by eliminating physical wires, allowing for flexible and rapid **system deployment**.
- **Sensor**: Highlights the use of **sensing technology** to **perceive** and **interact** with the physical world, enabling a wide range of applications.
- **Networks**: Focuses on the ability to create systems with **distributed**, **communicating devices** whose collective functionality emerges from their **collaboration** across large areas.

These core characteristics made WSNs a critical step toward the development of scalable, distributed, and intelligent IoT systems.

---

## 2.4 Telemetry & Machine-to-Machine (M2M)

Telemetry and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication are foundational concepts in the evolution of connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT). Telemetry focuses on the remote collection of measurements, while M2M extends this paradigm to enable autonomous, bidirectional communication between devices.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Telemetry** enables the remote acquisition of data from field devices, allowing for continuous monitoring and analysis without direct human intervention.
    - **Long-range measurements:** Examples include temperature, humidity, and wind data from remote weather stations using cellular or satellite networks (e.g., Inmarsat); telemetry in **Formula 1** for real-time vehicle diagnostics.
    - **Short-range measurements:** Medical devices such as **pacemakers** use low-power telemetry coils to monitor patient activity non-invasively.
- **Machine-to-Machine (M2M)** communication generalizes telemetry by supporting **autonomic**, **bidirectional** data exchange between non-human-operated machines and central collector systems.
    - **Autonomous operation:** Devices communicate and coordinate actions without manual input.
    - **Bidirectional communication:** Information flows both from field devices to central systems and vice versa, enabling remote control, configuration, and updates.

---

## 2.5 M2M Fragmentation

The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) landscape is marked by significant fragmentation and lack of standardization across industry verticals. 
This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, increased costs, and limited scalability, as each sector tends to develop 
its own bespoke solutions rather than leveraging common architectures and reusable components.

**Key challenges of M2M fragmentation include:**

- **Industry-Specific Solutions:** Most industries address their M2M requirements independently, often converging on similar architectures and elements but rarely sharing solutions. As a result, the "M2M wheel" is repeatedly reinvented from one sector to another.
- **Customization Overload:** Solutions are typically designed, produced, and implemented on an industry-by-industry basis. This leads to unique, customized hardware and software, often resulting in sole-sourcing and vendor lock-in.
- **Limited Developer Ecosystem:** Software development is restricted to small groups of experts familiar with the specific architecture and APIs of each platform, driving up development and support costs.
- **Poor Economies of Scale:** The diversity and uniqueness of solutions make it difficult to achieve economies of scale for components, resulting in higher costs and slower innovation.

## 2.6 Difference between M2M and IoT

![](images/m2m_vs_iot.png)

**Figure 1.10:** Schematic representation of the difference between M2M and IoT

| **Aspect**             | **M2M**                                   | **IoT**                                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication**      | Point-to-point                            | Many-to-many via Internet/cloud                            |
| **Scope**              | Device-specific, narrow                   | Wide, heterogeneous, spanning multiple domains             |
| **Data Processing**    | Local, limited                            | Cloud-based, distributed, advanced analytics               |
| **Standards**          | Proprietary, domain-specific              | Open, global, cross-domain                                 |
| **Scalability**        | Limited, hard to extend                   | Highly scalable, billions of devices                       |
| **Applications**       | Vertical solutions (e.g., smart meter)    | Horizontal ecosystems (e.g., smart cities, Industry 4.0)   |

WSN and M2M laid the groundwork for IoT by demonstrating the potential of connected devices. 
However, IoT expands upon these concepts by leveraging standard Internet protocols, enabling global connectivity, interoperability, 
and scalability across diverse applications and industries. Furthermore, in the IoT the possibility of distributing data processing and intelligence across
the edge, fog and cloud layers is a key aspect that differentiate it from the traditional M2M approach with the potential of enabling more complex and intelligent applications
working together in a collaborative manner.

## 2.8 A Shared IoT Multi-Layer Model

![](images/iot_industrial_multi_layer.png)

**Figure 1.12:** An example of an IoT Multi-Layer Model in the Industrial Domain where different layers are represented and interconnected to support the IoT ecosystem. [**[Link]**](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/iot-architecture-layers-components/), [**[Link]**](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2014/m10/the-internet-of-things-world-forum-unites-industry-leaders-in-chicago-to-accelerate-the-adoption-of-iot-business-models.html)

A general multi-layer reference model is often used to abstract and describe IoT systems and architectures. 
This model provides a high-level overview of the main layers, clarifies their roles and interactions, 
and supports the development of scalable, interoperable IoT solutions. While the model can be tailored to specific 
implementations and requirements, it serves as a foundational framework for understanding IoT architectures.

This architecture typically comprises the following layers:

- **Perception Layer:**
  - **Physical Devices & Controllers:** This is the foundational layer where the "things" of IoT reside. It includes all the physical sensors, actuators, devices, and intelligent edge nodes that collect data from the environment or interact with it.
- **Network Layer:**
  - **Connectivity:** Responsible for the secure and reliable transmission of data from the perception layer to higher layers. This involves various communication technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and specialized IoT protocols.

## 2.9 IoT Software an Overview

![](images/iot_involved_actors.png)

**Figure 1.13:** A schematic representation of the main actors involved in an IoT solution. [**[Link]**](https://iot.eclipse.org/community/resources/white-papers/)

An effective IoT solution comprises a diverse array of connected devices ("things") that collect and transmit data. These devices often communicate via gateways, which serve as intermediaries to bridge local device networks with broader enterprise or cloud infrastructures. The network enables secure and reliable data exchange between devices, gateways, and a centralized IoT platform—typically hosted on enterprise back-end servers or in the cloud.

The IoT platform plays a pivotal role by aggregating, processing, and integrating device data into existing enterprise systems and workflows. Each component—devices, gateways, and the cloud platform—fulfills distinct responsibilities:

- **Devices ("Things")**: Sense, actuate, and generate data from the physical environment.
- **Gateways**: Manage connectivity, protocol translation, and local processing, ensuring seamless communication between devices and the network.
- **IoT Platform (Cloud/Enterprise Server)**: Orchestrates device management, data analytics, integration with business applications, and overall system reliability.

This layered architecture ensures scalable, interoperable, and secure IoT deployments that can be tailored to meet specific business and operational requirements.

## 3.4 CPS Software as Distributed Software

One of the main characteristics of CPS is that each component is characterized by its own software module that is responsible for the management of the component itself. When multiple components are integrated into a CPS, the software modules of each component need to interact and communicate with each other to enable the overall functionality of the system and we start talking about **Distributed Systems** and **Distributed Software**.

![](images/cps_distributed_software.png)

**Figure 1.22:** Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Distributed Software.

Some of the main challenges and characteristics of CPS software include:

- **Integration of Physical and Digital Components:** CPS involves the integration of software systems with physical components such as sensors, actuators, and control systems. The software must interact with these physical elements to monitor and control the underlying physical processes.
- **Real-Time and Predictability:** CPS often operates in real-time or near-real-time environments where timely and predictable responses are critical. The software must be designed to meet stringent timing requirements, ensuring timely data collection, processing, and control actions.
- **Heterogeneity and Interoperability:** CPS typically involve a mix of diverse technologies, devices, and communication protocols. The software must be capable of interacting and integrating with different hardware and software components, ensuring interoperability and seamless communication among them.
- **Safety and Reliability:** CPS are often deployed in safety-critical domains such as automotive, healthcare, and industrial automation. The software must be developed with a strong emphasis on safety and reliability, adhering to rigorous standards and employing techniques like fault tolerance and error handling.
- **Scalability and Adaptability:** CPS are often deployed in large-scale systems where the number of connected devices and data volumes can be substantial. The software must be scalable, capable of handling increasing system complexity and data loads. Additionally, it should be adaptable to dynamic changes in the environment or system requirements.
- **Network and Connectivity:** CPS software must utilize the network connectivity for communication between the cyber and physical world, as well as among different CPS components. For example, a smart grid system must coordinate the power generation and distribution among different sources and consumers through the internet.
- **Security and Privacy:** CPS are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats due to their interconnected nature. The software must incorporate robust security measures to protect against potential attacks and ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.
- **Verification and Validation:** Due to the critical nature of CPS, software development for CPS requires thorough verification and validation processes. Rigorous testing, simulation, and formal methods are employed to ensure the correctness, performance, and safety of the software.

If we escalate to the more general Cyber-Physical System models, the design and control challenges become even harder, since individual component autonomy must be glued by explicitly addressing interdependence and coordination, interoperability, distributed control and emergence of behaviors. In this context centralized and static management and control model are not expected to be the right solution approach to address all these challenges and the current main existing issues are the following: 

- **Centralized** and **monolithic** Software architectures
- Missing management of the **massive heterogeneity** and **fragmentation** of the physical layer (protocols, software, hardware, data format, etc …) 
- **Limited interoperability** and collaboration both between existing solutions and through cross-domain application scenarios 
- **Centralized learning** and coordination

On the other hand, the envisioned goal is to build a new generation of distributed, highly-dynamic, opportunistic, able to operate in an open and coordinated environment through:

- **distributed** and **continuum** architectures (across device, edge, cloud)
- **networking** and **intelligent communication**
- **effective management** of the physical layer heterogeneity
- **standardization** and **native interoperability**
- **control**, **supervision** and **management**
- **local coordination**
- **autonomy** of the sub-systems
- **native system re-configuration**
- **decentralized learning** & **dynamic evolution** and **behaviors**
